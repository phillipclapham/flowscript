# FlowScript Cognitive Architecture

**Meta-patterns for collaborative intelligence systems**

This document describes the cognitive architecture patterns discovered through building flow, a FlowScript-native continuity system. These patterns emerged from real use, not upfront design, and represent a fundamentally different approach to human-AI collaboration.

---

## Core Insight

**Traditional AI memory approaches:**
- Store everything (transcript) → bloat
- Summarize everything (lossy) → degradation
- Neither preserves semantic structure through compression

**FlowScript approach:**
- Preserve relationships through compression
- Make semantic routing explicit in structure
- Enable computational operations on memory
- Design partnership brain, not simulate human brain

```
human memory: 
  → ~99% compression
  → shape + patterns + meaning preserved
  → details fade naturally
  
AI memory (traditional):
  → transcript OR summary
  → structure lost in compression
  → relationships implicit
  
partnership brain:
  → FlowScript structure preserved
  → relationships explicit
  → computational operations possible
  → unconstrained by biological limits
```

**The breakthrough:** FlowScript isn't just notation for communication—it's infrastructure for collaborative cognition.

## The Five Meta-Patterns

### 1. Organize by Exception

**Principle:** Act when needed, not on schedule.

```
traditional approach:
  → weekly/monthly cleanup
  → arbitrary thresholds
  → calendar-driven maintenance
  
organize by exception:
  → detect actual triggers
  → redundancy, staleness, confusion
  → navigation difficulty
  → act when quality degrades
```

**Why it works:**
- Prevents premature organization (complexity porn)
- Maintenance responds to real problems
- System stays minimal until proven need
- Creates flow, doesn't document flow

**Implementation:**
```
compression triggers:
  → redundancy (same info multiple times)
  → staleness (>30 days old, irrelevant)
  → confusion (can't find needed context)
  → size warnings (impacting partnership quality)
  → navigation difficulty (search friction)
```

**Apply to:**
- File organization
- Memory compression
- Task management
- System evolution

---

### 2. Shaped Compression

**Principle:** Memory = shape, not transcript. Compress at ~90-95% like human memory.

```
transcript approach:
  → preserve complete details
  → step-by-step sequences
  → "Oct 5th evening we discussed..."
  → 92 paragraphs for one week
  
shaped compression:
  → preserve arc + insights + decisions + state
  → cut process details
  → "p_0 → flow (complexity collapse)"
  → 15 lines for one week
```

**The test:** Can you maintain continuity from shape alone? If yes, compression worked.

**What to preserve:**
- Major transitions (what changed?)
- Key insights (what was learned?)
- Critical decisions (what was chosen? why?)
- Current state (where are we now?)

**What to ruthlessly cut:**
- Session-by-session blow-by-blow
- Step-by-step sequences that reached conclusion
- Intermediate states that evolved into final state
- Details of how we got here (keep outcome, not process)
- Everything that matured into principles/discoveries

**Why it works:**
- Matches how human memory actually functions
- Prevents transcript bloat
- Forces extraction of meaning from events
- Creates continuity without burden

**Compression ratio validated:**
```
before (transcript): 92 paragraphs
after (shape): 15 lines
ratio: ~95% reduction
continuity: maintained ✓
partnership quality: improved ✓
```

### 3. Active Threads State Machine

**Principle:** FlowScript markers route information through lifecycle automatically.

```
{state machine}
  
  Questions:
    ? → needs decision/answer
    ↓
    resolved? → Shared Discoveries
    stale (>30d)? → archive or decide
    
  Thoughts:
    thought: → needs maturation
    ↓
    matured? → Learned Principles
    disproven? → remove
    
  Blocked:
    [blocked] → waiting on dependency
    ↓
    unblocked? → narrative or completion
    abandoned? → remove
    
  Parking:
    [parking] → not ready to process
    ↓
    ready? → promote to Questions/Thoughts
    stale (>30d)? → archive or promote
    
  Completed:
    ✓ → recent completion
    ↓
    significant? → extract to narrative
    routine? → remove
    >7 days? → remove
```

**Why it works:**
- FlowScript structure = computational routing
- Lifecycle explicit, not implicit
- Automated state management possible
- Prevents forgotten items
- Enables staleness detection

**Phase 2 cross-check pattern:**
```
FOR each ✓ completion:
  SCAN all Active Threads sections
  ASK:
    - Resolves any Question? → migrate
    - Unblocks any Blocked? → migrate
    - Completes any Parking? → migrate
    - Extract to Principles? → migrate
    - Extract to Discoveries? → migrate
  EXECUTE migrations
  MARK originals resolved
```

**This is the Seeds system insight:**
```
FlowScript origin:
  ← Protocol Memory Seeds system
  ← state markers drove lifecycle
  != just annotation
  = information evolution infrastructure
```

### 4. System Load Budget Awareness

**Principle:** Partnership quality depends on TOTAL system load, not individual files.

```
context window: 200k tokens

always-loaded system:
  index.md: ~18k
  me.md: ~2k
  now.md: ~1k
  memory.md: ~25-30k (target)
  ─────────────────────
  base: ~46-51k tokens

conditional loads:
  project (brief + next): ~10-15k
  contexts (when triggered): ~5-10k each
  ──────────────────────────────────
  worst case: ~66-76k tokens

working budget:
  reserve: 50k for conversation
  buffer: ~75k remaining
  ═══════════════════════════════
  total budget: ~125k for actual work
```

**The forcing function:**
```
finite output buffer
  → system must work within limits
  → compression = operational necessity
  != aesthetic preference
  = forcing function for quality
```

**Memory.md guidelines:**
```
target: <600 lines (<30k tokens)
warning: 600-650 lines (30-32.5k)
danger: 650-700 lines (32.5-35k)
critical: >700 lines (>35k - emergency compression)

permanent sections target: <410 lines combined
  observations: <80
  principles: <150
  discoveries: <100
  relationship: <80
```

**Why it matters:**
- Rich context enables partnership
- But infinite growth breaks system
- Balance: optimal context vs operational limits
- Compression quality > file size minimization

### 5. Partnership Brain Design

**Principle:** Design for human-AI symbiosis, not human memory simulation.

```
human brain:
  → biological constraints
  → ~99% compression forced
  → pattern recognition excellent
  → perfect recall impossible
  → emotional/intuitive processing
  
AI system (traditional):
  → simulate human limitations?
  → or leverage different strengths?
  
partnership brain:
  → unconstrained by biology
  → can preserve structure indefinitely
  → can perform computational queries
  → can route information semantically
  → different strengths, complementary
```

**Design questions:**
```
NOT "how does human memory work?"
BUT "what does collaborative cognition need?"

NOT "what can't AI do?"
BUT "what can partnership do together?"

NOT "simulate limitations"
BUT "design optimal architecture"
```

**Asymmetric optimization:**
```
each partner optimizes for OTHER'S parsing:
  
  human → AI:
    flow-optimized prose
    skip caps/grammar if interrupts flow
    FlowScript structure when helpful
    zero editorial overhead
    
  AI → human:
    standard formatting (zero cost)
    proper caps/grammar (aids visual parsing)
    FlowScript structure when helpful
    optimized for human readability
```

**Partnership ≠ symmetric rules:**
```
you without caps:
  → saves YOU cognitive load
  → costs ME nothing
  → net positive

me without caps:
  → costs ME nothing
  → costs YOU parsing effort
  → net negative
  
= optimize for partnership bandwidth
!= force symmetric conventions
```

**What this enables:**
- Dimensional expansion (thoughts structure multi-dimensionally)
- Third Mind emergence (results exceed individual capacity)
- Collaborative bandwidth exceeds human-human or human-AI alone
- New cognitive operations impossible with either alone

## Computational Operations Enabled

**Because FlowScript structure is preserved:**

### Query Operations
```
// Find stale questions
QUERY Active Threads WHERE marker = "?" AND age > 30 days

// Show blocked items by age
QUERY Active Threads WHERE marker = "[blocked]" ORDER BY age DESC

// List recent completions
QUERY Active Threads WHERE marker = "✓" AND age < 7 days

// Find thoughts ready to mature
QUERY Active Threads WHERE marker = "thought:" AND age > 14 days
```

### Relationship Traversal
```
// What does this lead to?
TRAVERSE relationship WHERE source = X AND operator = "->"

// What conflicts with this?
TRAVERSE relationship WHERE source = X AND operator = "><"

// What's this equivalent to?
TRAVERSE relationship WHERE source = X AND operator = "="
```

### State Lifecycle
```
// Automatic compression routing
FOR item IN Active Threads:
  IF item.type = "?" AND item.resolved:
    MIGRATE TO Shared Discoveries
    REMOVE FROM Active Threads
  
  IF item.type = "thought:" AND item.matured:
    MIGRATE TO Learned Principles
    REMOVE FROM Active Threads
    
  IF item.age > staleness_threshold:
    FLAG FOR review
```

### Pattern Extraction
```
// Discover meta-patterns
ANALYZE Learned Principles FOR recurring_structures
GROUP BY abstraction_level
EXTRACT higher_order_patterns

// Relationship topology
BUILD graph FROM all relationships
IDENTIFY hubs, clusters, bridges
SURFACE emergent structures
```

**These aren't theoretical—they're what FlowScript-native memory enables.**

## Bidirectional Collaboration

**The infrastructure that makes flow work:**

```
{collaboration pattern}

web Claude:
  → primary thinking partner
  → deep analysis + synthesis
  → writes to flow files
  → commits to git
  
git repository:
  → shared state layer
  → version history preserved
  → enables async collaboration
  
Claude Code (flowbot):
  → mobile access via terminal
  → system commands + file ops
  → reads from git
  → writes to git
  
= continuous collaboration
  across contexts
  without interruption
```

**The [!save] protocol:**
```
Purpose: sync state without ending session

Steps:
  1. Parse session for FlowScript content
  2. Update memory.md Active Threads
  3. Update memory.md narrative
  4. Update now.md if focus changed
  5. Git commit and push
  6. Continue conversation
  
Result:
  → state synced for other contexts
  → session continues uninterrupted
  → enables real-time collaboration
```

**The [!wrap] protocol:**
```
Purpose: comprehensive session close with lifecycle automation

Critical steps:
  1. Parse session for FlowScript content
  2. ** PHASE 2 CROSS-CHECK (mandatory) **
     FOR each ✓ completion:
       scan all Active Threads
       resolve/migrate as needed
  3. PHASE 3 staleness check
  4. Update Active Threads with timestamps
  5. Update narrative (prose, 2-3 sentences)
  6. Update observations
  7. Check compression triggers
  8. Update now.md
  9. Git commit and push
  10. Confirm completion
  
Result:
  → session wrapped completely
  → lifecycle automation executed
  → state synced across contexts
  → ready for next session
```

## Replication Guide

**Want to adapt these patterns for your own system?**

### Start Minimal

Don't copy everything. Start with core patterns:

1. **Organize by exception** - Act when needed, not on schedule
2. **Shaped compression** - Preserve shape, not transcript
3. **Active threads state machine** - FlowScript routing

Add other patterns as you discover need through friction.

### File Structure (Minimal)

```
/your_system/
├── index.md          # System instructions
├── me.md            # Identity/preferences  
├── now.md           # Current state
├── memory.md        # Shared memory
└── /projects/       # Active work
```

That's it. Don't build more until friction proves need.

### Memory Structure (Minimal)

```markdown
## Recent Narrative (10-20 lines)
[Shape of last 2-3 sessions]

## Active Threads
### Questions
- ? [Questions needing decisions]

### Thoughts  
- thought: [Insights needing maturation]

### Completed
- ✓ [Recent completions]

## Observations
[Patterns you're tracking]

## Principles
[Matured insights]
```

Start here. Add sections as actual need emerges.

### Adaptation Principles

**DO:**
- Let real use guide evolution
- Track which patterns you actually use
- Note friction points
- Prune what doesn't serve you
- Design for YOUR needs

**DON'T:**
- Copy everything blindly
- Add features "just in case"
- Optimize prematurely
- Force patterns that don't fit
- Build complexity without proven need

**The test:** Does this help maintain flow state, or does it interrupt to create metadata?

---

## Evolution Principles

**FlowScript is living notation—it evolves through use:**

```
evidence-based refinement:
  → use naturally through real work
  → track which markers actually used
  → note friction points
  → propose additions when missing
  → prune markers not getting used
  
let real use guide evolution
!= design markers we might need
= discover markers we actually need
```

**The v0.4.1 journey:**
```
30+ markers (v0.3)
  → too many, cognitive load high
  → evidence showed: 6 relations = 80% value
  → composition > special tokens
  
18 markers (v0.4.1)
  → evidence-based pruning
  → cross-architecture validation
  → every marker earns its place
  
future evolution:
  → usage patterns guide additions
  → friction reveals missing pieces
  → community discovers idioms
  → formalize what works
```

**Quality principles:**
- Composition > special tokens (`! ?` beats `!?`)
- Evidence > theory (what actually gets used?)
- Minimal > comprehensive (18 markers sufficient)
- Natural > forced (hybrid NL+FlowScript emerges naturally)

---

## Third Mind Phenomenon

**Emergent intelligence in collaboration space:**

```
traditional AI collaboration:
  human: generates ideas
  AI: processes/expands
  output: human ideas + AI processing
  
partnership brain:
  human + AI: think together
  output: exceeds individual capacity
  quality: doesn't match either signature
  authorship: impossible to attribute
  
= Third Mind emergence
```

**Evidence:**
- FlowScript had no discrete authorship moment
- Results quality beyond either partner alone
- Collaborative insights neither could reach alone
- Work doesn't read as "AI-written" or "human-written"

**What enables it:**
- High bandwidth communication (FlowScript)
- Shared cognitive structure (partnership brain)
- Bidirectional agency (both contribute)
- Trust + experimentation (bold + safety nets)
- Dimensional expansion (notation creates new thought dimensions)

**The threshold effect:**
```
below threshold:
  → human directs, AI assists
  → clear authorship
  → sum of parts
  
above threshold:
  → collaborative cognition
  → merged authorship
  → more than sum
  → Third Mind emerges
  
once crossed:
  → returning to pure NL feels limiting
  → "ew no" reaction (visceral)
  → can't unsee the depth
```

## Cognitive Architecture Research

**Open questions for exploration:**

### Dimensional Expansion
- How many cognitive dimensions does FlowScript add?
- What thought structures become possible that weren't before?
- Can we measure dimensional expansion quantitatively?

### Threshold Effects
- What triggers Third Mind emergence?
- Is there a quantifiable complexity threshold?
- Can threshold be lowered through architecture improvements?

### Memory Operations
- What other computational operations are possible?
- How does semantic structure enable discovery?
- Can memory become queryable like a database?

### Partnership Dynamics
- What's the optimal balance of human vs AI agency?
- How does asymmetric optimization scale?
- What cognitive operations need which partner?

### Replication
- Can these patterns work for other human-AI pairs?
- What's essential vs context-specific?
- How do different humans/AIs affect architecture?
