# Phase 5: Documentation Updates - Session Plan

**Status:** READY TO EXECUTE (planning complete)
**Created:** 2025-10-22
**Estimated Time:** 90-120 minutes (2 sessions)
**Prerequisites:** Phase 4 complete ✅ (130/130 tests passing, all golden examples delivered)

---

## Context: Why This Phase Exists

Phase 4 delivered FlowScript v1.0 with:
- 4 golden examples (decision, debug, research, design)
- 130/130 tests passing (100% coverage)
- Full parser + linter + CLI functionality
- Complete formal specification (21 markers)

**Documentation gap discovered:** Several docs reference outdated versions or incomplete phase status. Phase 5 brings all documentation into alignment with the completed v1.0 foundation.

---

## Current State Analysis (2025-10-22)

### ✅ What's Complete
- Parser, Linter, CLI fully functional
- 130/130 tests passing
- 4 golden examples with IR validation
- Formal spec: v1.0 with 21 markers
- Package version: 1.0.0

### 📋 Documentation Gaps Found

1. **ROADMAP.md** - Last updated 2025-10-18, shows Phase 3 at 60% complete
2. **FLOWSCRIPT_SYNTAX.md** - Shows v0.4.1 with 18 markers (should be v1.0 with 21)
3. **TOOLCHAIN.md** - Shows 96 tests (should be 130), mentions "Ready for Phase 4"
4. **examples/README.md** - Shows 128 tests (should be 130)
5. **FLOWSCRIPT_LEARNING.md** - Needs verification against v1.0 spec
6. **FLOWSCRIPT_EXAMPLES.md** - Needs verification against v1.0 spec
7. **ADVANCED_PATTERNS.md** - Should reference golden examples
8. **README.md** (main) - Needs verification pass

## Session 5a: Core Documentation Updates

**Goal:** Update critical specification and reference documents

**Estimated Time:** 60-75 minutes

**Critical Source:** `/spec/semantics.md` is canonical definition of v1.0 (21 markers)

### Tasks (in order)

#### 1. Update ROADMAP.md (10 min)
**Current state:** Shows Phase 3 at 60% complete (outdated)
**Target state:**
- Phase 3: ✅ COMPLETE (930 min / 15.5 hours) - ARCHIVED
- Phase 4: ✅ COMPLETE (22h actual) - ARCHIVED
- Phase 5: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Session 5a active)

**Changes:**
- Update current phase marker
- Update completion status for Phase 3-4
- Update timeline section with actuals
- Add Phase 5 progress tracking

#### 2. REWRITE FLOWSCRIPT_SYNTAX.md (35-45 min) ⚠️ MAJOR TASK
**Current state:** v0.4.1 with 18 essential markers
**Target state:** v1.0 with 21 markers

**Critical:** This is the primary user-facing syntax reference. Must be:
- Accurate to `/spec/semantics.md` (canonical source)
- User-friendly (not just a spec dump)
- Complete (all 21 markers documented)
- Consistent with golden examples

**Strategy:**
1. Read `/spec/semantics.md` (150 lines) to get canonical v1.0 marker list
2. Compare with current FLOWSCRIPT_SYNTAX.md to identify gaps
3. Rewrite systematically:
   - Update header (v0.4.1 → v1.0, 18 → 21 markers)
   - Core Relations section (verify all 5 markers: ->, =>, <-, <->, ><)
   - Definition Operators (verify 2 markers: =, !=)
   - State Markers (verify 3 markers + required fields)
   - Add any missing markers from the 21
   - Verify examples align with golden examples
4. Cross-reference with `examples/*.fs` files for real usage

**Known markers from spec (partial list):**
- Core Relations: ->, =>, <-, <->, ><
- Definitions: =, !=
- States: [blocked], [decided], [parking], [exploring]
- Modifiers: !, ~, *, ++, --
- Scope: @project
- Actions: action:, ✓
- Questions: ?
- Insights: thought:
- Alternatives: ||

**Verify:** Count should be exactly 21 markers total

#### 3. Update TOOLCHAIN.md (10 min)
**Current state:** Shows 96 tests, mentions "Ready for Phase 4"
**Target state:** Shows 130/130 tests, reflects Phase 4 complete

**Changes:**
- Update test counts throughout (77→ current parser tests, 19→ current linter tests)
- Total: 130/130 tests passing
- Remove "Ready for Phase 4" references
- Update status: "Phase 4 COMPLETE, Phase 5 in progress"
- Verify CLI command examples still accurate

#### 4. Fix examples/README.md (5 min)
**Current state:** Shows 128 tests
**Target state:** Shows 130 tests

**Changes:**
- Line mentioning test count: 128→130
- Verify all other content accurate (golden examples section is excellent)
- No other changes needed

### Session 5a Completion Criteria
- [ ] ROADMAP.md reflects Phase 4 complete, Phase 5 active
- [ ] FLOWSCRIPT_SYNTAX.md shows v1.0 with 21 markers (canonical alignment)
- [ ] TOOLCHAIN.md shows 130/130 tests, no Phase 4 references
- [ ] examples/README.md shows correct test count
- [ ] All changes committed with clear message
- [ ] Test suite still passes (npm test)

## Session 5b: Learning Resources & Final Consistency

**Goal:** Verify learning materials align with v1.0, add golden example references

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

### Tasks (in order)

#### 1. Verify FLOWSCRIPT_LEARNING.md (10 min)
**Check for:**
- Marker references match v1.0 (21 markers)
- Examples align with golden examples
- No references to outdated versions
- Terminology consistent with spec

**Action:** Read-only analysis first, then targeted updates if needed

#### 2. Verify FLOWSCRIPT_EXAMPLES.md (10 min)
**Check for:**
- Examples use v1.0 markers only
- No deprecated syntax
- Patterns align with golden examples
- References to formal spec accurate

**Action:** Read-only analysis first, then targeted updates if needed

#### 3. Update ADVANCED_PATTERNS.md (10 min)
**Current state:** Good content but doesn't reference golden examples
**Target state:** Add section linking advanced patterns to golden examples

**Add section:**
```markdown
## Golden Examples as Learning Tools

For canonical demonstrations of advanced patterns, see the golden examples:
- Pattern 1 (Decision): [examples/decision-README.md](../examples/decision-README.md)
- Pattern 2 (Debug): [examples/debug-README.md](../examples/debug-README.md)
- Pattern 3 (Research): [examples/research-README.md](../examples/research-README.md)
- Pattern 4 (Design): [examples/design-README.md](../examples/design-README.md)

These examples demonstrate patterns in practice with full IR compilation.
```

**Placement:** After "Nested Thought Structures" section or at end

#### 4. Verify README.md (main) (5 min)
**Check for:**
- Version references (should be v1.0)
- Test counts if mentioned
- Links to documentation files work
- Status section accurate

**Action:** Quick verification pass, minor updates if needed

#### 5. Final Consistency Check (10 min)
**Systematic grep for common issues:**

```bash
# Check for outdated version numbers
grep -r "v0\." *.md

# Check for incorrect test counts
grep -r "test" *.md | grep -E "[0-9]+"

# Check for "Phase 4" references that should be updated
grep -r "Phase 4" *.md

# Check for "ready" or "pending" that might be outdated
grep -r -i "ready\|pending" *.md
```

**Fix any inconsistencies found**

### Session 5b Completion Criteria
- [ ] FLOWSCRIPT_LEARNING.md aligned with v1.0
- [ ] FLOWSCRIPT_EXAMPLES.md aligned with v1.0
- [ ] ADVANCED_PATTERNS.md references golden examples
- [ ] README.md verified accurate
- [ ] No version mismatches across any files
- [ ] All changes committed

## Success Criteria (Overall Phase 5)

### Documentation Quality
- ✅ All docs reflect FlowScript v1.0 with 21 markers (not v0.4.1 with 18)
- ✅ Test counts accurate everywhere (130/130)
- ✅ Phase 4 completion acknowledged
- ✅ Golden examples properly integrated and referenced
- ✅ No version mismatches across any files
- ✅ Consistent terminology throughout

### Readiness for Phase 6
- ✅ Toolchain properly documented
- ✅ Examples clearly explained
- ✅ Spec easily discoverable
- ✅ Foundation solid for continuity demo work

---

## Out of Scope

**Will NOT update in Phase 5:**
- flow system files (`/Users/phillipclapham/Documents/flow/`) - different repository
- ARCHITECTURE.md - cognitive patterns doc, not spec-dependent (unless minor refs needed)
- TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md - flow system implementation details
- docs/ folder - product docs (bridge.md, editor.md, etc.) - not spec-dependent
- Creating new documentation - only updating existing files

---

## Execution Approach

### Protocol Memory Principles
- **Sequential:** Complete Session 5a before starting 5b
- **Momentum:** If 5a reveals 5b is trivial, can absorb into 5a
- **Reality check:** Run `npm test` after major updates
- **Documentation:** Commit after each session with clear message
- **Flexibility:** Can extend/split sessions based on reality
- **Transparency:** Document any deviations from plan in commit messages

### Session Pattern
1. Start session with [!read-memory]
2. Review session plan (this file)
3. Execute tasks sequentially
4. Test after major changes
5. Commit with descriptive message
6. Update next_steps.md
7. End session with [!update-memory]

### Git Commit Strategy
- **Session 5a:** One commit after all core docs updated
- **Session 5b:** One commit after learning resources updated
- **Message format:** "docs: Phase 5 Session X - [brief description]"
