# FlowScript Product Vision

**Status:** Exploratory concepts, not commitments
**Timeline:** TBD based on community validation
**Foundation:** FlowScript notation (open source, MIT license)

---

## Purpose of This Document

This describes two product concepts we're exploring based on FlowScript notation. These are:

- ❌ **NOT promises** or roadmap commitments
- ❌ **NOT required** to use FlowScript (notation is free/open)
- ✅ Explorations of how the notation might be productized
- ✅ Subject to change based on evidence and validation

**FlowScript as notation is complete, open source, and works today.** These products are speculative applications of that foundation.

## The Language Bottleneck Problem

AI democratized *access* to intelligence, not *utilization* of it.

**The reality:**
- Getting great AI results requires precise, structured prompts
- Most people lack the language mastery for complex prompts
- Power users need even more precision than prose allows
- Result: Language remains the bottleneck

**This creates two distinct problems that need different solutions.**

---

## Concept 1: The Bridge

**Tagline:** Better AI results without learning notation

### The Problem

You know what you want to ask. You can't express it precisely.

```
In your head:
"I need a detailed comparison of three approaches,
considering scalability, cost, and team expertise.
Show tradeoffs. Give actionable recommendations."

What you type:
"What's better, microservices or monolith?"

What you get:
Generic comparison. No depth. Not useful.
```

**The gap between thought and expression = language bottleneck for general users.**

### The Solution Concept

**Simple input interface:**
- What do you need?
- What context matters?
- How should the answer look?

**FlowScript generation (hidden):**
- System generates structured prompt using FlowScript
- User never sees the syntax
- Works with any AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)

**Better results:**
- Context-aware, precise answers
- First-time accuracy
- No syntax to learn

### Who It's For

**Target:** General users frustrated with AI responses

Specifically:
- Non-technical professionals needing technical answers
- Students researching without knowing how to ask
- Small business owners needing strategic guidance
- Anyone who needs AI for complex tasks but lacks prompt engineering skills

**If you've thought "the AI doesn't understand what I need" - this concept addresses that.**

### Example Flow

**User input:**
```
NEED: Debug why my website is slow
CONTEXT: React app, lots of images, hosted on Vercel
OUTPUT: Specific problems and how to fix each one
```

**Generated (behind the scenes):**
```
{
  context: {
    ! issue: website performance
    stack: React + Vercel
    hypothesis: image loading problem
  }

  ? root causes: performance bottleneck
  -> investigate: image optimization
  -> investigate: React rendering
  -> investigate: network/hosting

  output: {
    format: diagnostic breakdown
    -> per issue: problem + solution + priority
    action: implementation steps
  }
}
```

**Result:** AI identifies specific issues (image lazy loading, component re-rendering, CDN config) with prioritized fixes and implementation steps.

### Pricing Concept (Speculative)

**Freemium model:**
- Free: 10 prompts/month, basic templates
- Pro ($9/month): Unlimited prompts, advanced templates, history
- Enterprise: Team features, API access, custom templates

### Status & Reality Check

**What we know:**
- FlowScript improves AI responses (validated across architectures)
- Prompt engineering is a real skill gap for general users
- Hiding complexity behind simple interface is proven pattern

**What we DON'T know:**
- Will there be demand for "prompt engineering as a service"?
- Can we make the interface simple enough?
- What's the right pricing if we build it?
- Timeline for validation/development?

**This is an exploration, not a promise.**

## Concept 2: The Editor

**Tagline:** IDE for structured communication with AI

### The Problem

You can write clearly. But prose buries complexity.

```
Your thought:
"Auth system connects to three services. If Redis fails,
fallback to Postgres (slower). Speed vs reliability tradeoff.
Testing blocked on staging. Need architecture decision first."

Your prose:
"The auth system is complex. It uses Redis for speed but
we need Postgres as backup. There are tradeoffs. We should
test in staging. We need to decide on the architecture."

What AI understands:
Vague overview. Unclear relationships. Ambiguous priorities.
```

**Problem: Prose is linear. Complex thoughts are graphs.**

### The Solution Concept

**IDE-like environment with three panes:**

1. **Text editor** - Write FlowScript with syntax highlighting
2. **Visual preview** - See structure as graph in real-time
3. **JSON schema** - Generate structured outputs (optional)

**Example:**
```
auth system:
  -> Redis (primary)
     ++ speed
     risk: single point of failure
  -> Postgres (fallback)
     ++ reliability
     ~ performance

speed >< reliability = tradeoff requiring decision

! [blocked] testing <- staging environment broken

[decided] architecture review before implementation
```

**Visual preview shows:**
- Dependencies explicit (`->`)
- Tradeoffs visible (`><`)
- Blockers tracked (`[blocked]`)
- Decisions marked (`[decided]`)
- Uncertainty noted (`~`)

**Type on left. See structure on right. Export as needed.**

### Who It's For

**Target:** Power users who do complex technical work daily

Specifically:
- Programmers (system design, debugging, code review)
- Technical writers (complex documentation)
- Researchers (hypothesis mapping, methodology)
- Project managers (dependencies, blockers, decisions)
- Anyone who works with complex, interconnected information

**If you've ever drawn a diagram because prose wasn't clear enough - this concept addresses that.**

### Use Cases

**System architecture planning:**
- Map dependencies and tradeoffs
- Compare options visually
- Track decision factors
- Export to documentation

**Bug triage and debugging:**
- Trace investigation paths
- Map hypotheses to evidence
- Track blockers
- Document action sequences

**Feature planning:**
- Visualize dependencies
- Track sequence and status
- Identify risks
- Manage complexity

### Pricing Concept (Speculative)

**Open source core:**
- Text editor with syntax highlighting
- Basic visual preview
- Export as text/markdown
- MIT licensed, free forever

**Pro ($19/month):**
- Advanced graph visualization
- JSON schema generation
- All export formats
- Template library
- Cloud sync
- Revision history

**Enterprise:**
- Team features, custom integrations, SSO

### Learning Curve

**The Editor requires learning FlowScript syntax.**

This is intentional. The syntax is the tool.

**Time to proficiency:**
- 15 minutes: Understand core 3-4 markers
- 1 hour: Comfortable with basic structures
- 1 week: Fluent with common patterns
- 1 month: Creating complex thought maps naturally

**Learning resources exist:**
- [FLOWSCRIPT_LEARNING.md](../FLOWSCRIPT_LEARNING.md)
- [FLOWSCRIPT_SYNTAX.md](../FLOWSCRIPT_SYNTAX.md)
- [FLOWSCRIPT_EXAMPLES.md](../FLOWSCRIPT_EXAMPLES.md)

### Status & Reality Check

**What we know:**
- FlowScript enables precision beyond prose (validated through use)
- Power users already think in structure (diagrams, outlines)
- Real-time visual feedback improves understanding

**What we DON'T know:**
- Is there market demand for an "IDE for AI communication"?
- Will users invest time to learn the syntax?
- What's the right feature set vs complexity?
- Timeline for validation/development?

**This is an exploration, not a promise.**

## Why Two Products?

**You can't solve both problems with one tool.**

**For The Bridge (general users):**
- Hide complexity completely
- No learning curve
- Abstract away structure
- Effortless better results

**For The Editor (power users):**
- Expose full power
- Learning curve acceptable
- Show all structure
- Enable impossible expressions

**Trying to serve both = serving neither.**

Different audiences. Different needs. Different solutions.

---

## Why These Might NOT Work

**Let's be honest about risks:**

**The Bridge:**
- Prompt engineering as service might not have sustainable business model
- Users might not pay for something they can learn free
- Interface simplification might remove too much control
- Market might be smaller than we estimate

**The Editor:**
- Learning curve might be too steep for adoption
- Visual preview might not add enough value over plain text
- Power users might prefer their existing tools
- Market for "IDE for thought" might not exist at scale

**Both:**
- FlowScript itself might not prove valuable beyond early adopters
- Building products is hard, market timing matters
- Competition exists (other prompt tools, IDE extensions)
- We don't have product development experience

**We're building in public. Testing hypotheses. Learning from reality.**

## Current Status (October 2025)

**What exists today:**
- ✅ FlowScript v1.0 notation (complete, stable)
- ✅ Formal specification and grammar
- ✅ Parser + Linter + CLI toolchain (130/130 tests)
- ✅ Golden examples with IR validation
- ✅ Documentation and learning resources

**What does NOT exist:**
- ❌ The Bridge (no MVP, no mockups)
- ❌ The Editor (no MVP, no mockups)
- ❌ Market validation for either concept
- ❌ User research or demand data
- ❌ Timeline or roadmap commitments

**These are concepts. FlowScript is real. Products are speculative.**

## How to Engage

**If these concepts interest you:**

**For The Bridge:**
- Would you use "prompt engineering as a service"?
- What's your frustration with current AI interactions?
- What would make it valuable enough to pay for?

**For The Editor:**
- Would you learn FlowScript syntax for better AI communication?
- What features would make an "IDE for thought" valuable?
- What's missing from your current workflow?

**Open an issue:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/phillipclapham/flowscript/issues)
- Share your use cases
- Challenge our assumptions
- Propose alternatives
- Join the exploration

**We want evidence, not enthusiasm. Critique, not cheerleading.**

---

## The Bottom Line

**FlowScript as notation works today.** It's open source, complete, and validated.

**These product concepts** are explorations of how to make that notation more accessible (The Bridge) or more powerful (The Editor).

**We don't know if either will succeed.** We're sharing our thinking publicly to:
- Get feedback before building
- Find collaborators who see value
- Learn from people who'd actually use these
- Build evidence-based products, not speculative ones

**If you have complex thoughts to express to AI, FlowScript notation works today.** You don't need to wait for products.

**If these product concepts resonate, join the exploration.**
