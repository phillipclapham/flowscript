# The Editor: Power Tools for Technical Communication

*Express impossible thought structures. Amplify your mastery.*

**Status:** Concept phase, launching Q1 2026

---

## The Problem You Face

**You can write. You can think clearly. But prose buries complexity.**

```
Your thought (in your head):
"The auth system connects to three services. 
If Redis fails, fallback to Postgres but that's slower.
Speed vs reliability tradeoff. Both have cache implications.
Testing blocked until staging is fixed. 
Need to decide architecture before implementing."

Your prose (what you write):
"The auth system is complex. It uses Redis for speed but 
we need Postgres as backup. There are tradeoffs. We should 
test in staging. We need to decide on the architecture."

What the AI understands:
Vague overview. Unclear relationships. Ambiguous priorities.
```

**The problem isn't your writing. It's the medium.**

Prose is linear. Your thoughts are a graph.

---

## The Solution

**The Editor lets you write thoughts as graphs.**

```
auth system:
  -> Redis (primary)
     ++ speed
     risk: single point of failure
  -> Postgres (fallback)
     ++ reliability
     ~ performance

speed >< reliability = tradeoff requiring decision

! [blocked] testing <- staging environment broken

[decided] architecture review before implementation
-> need to resolve Redis vs Postgres priority
```

**Same thought. Dramatically clearer structure.**

- Dependencies explicit (`->`)
- Tradeoffs visible (`><`)
- Blockers tracked (`[blocked]`)
- Decisions marked (`[decided]`)
- Uncertainty noted (`~`)

**The Editor shows you this structure as you type - with a real-time visual graph.**

**Three panes:**
1. **Text editor** - Write FlowScript with syntax highlighting
2. **Visual preview** - See your thought structure as a graph in real-time
3. **JSON schema** - Generate structured outputs for deterministic AI responses

**Type on left. See structure on right. Export as needed.**

## Who It's For

**The Editor is for power users who:**

- Do complex technical work daily
- Already think in structure (outlines, diagrams, flowcharts)
- Need precision that prose can't provide
- Want to map relationships, not just ideas
- Use AI for architecture, debugging, planning, coordination

**Specifically:**
- **Programmers** - System design, debugging, code review documentation
- **Technical writers** - Complex documentation with clear dependencies
- **Researchers** - Hypothesis mapping, methodology structure
- **Project managers** - Task dependencies, blocker tracking, decision documentation
- **Legal/Grant writers** - Argument structure, precedent relationships
- **Anyone** who works with complex, interconnected information

**If you've ever drawn a diagram because prose wasn't clear enough - this is for you.**

---

## Core Features

### 1. FlowScript Text Editor

**Syntax highlighting:**
- Relations (`->`, `<-`, `<->`, `><`) in blue
- States (`[decided]`, `[blocked]`, `[exploring]`) in green
- Questions (`?`) and actions (`action:`) in orange
- Emphasis (`!`, `++`) in red
- Thought blocks (`{ }`) structured clearly

**Auto-completion:**
- Start typing `->` get relationship suggestions
- Type `[` get state options
- Common patterns auto-complete

**Validation:**
- Syntax errors highlighted
- Unclosed blocks flagged
- Invalid marker combinations caught
- Suggestions for fixes

---

### 2. Real-Time Visual Preview

**Graph visualization:**
- Nodes = thought blocks, concepts, entities
- Edges = relationships (arrows show direction)
- Colors = types (decisions, questions, blockers)
- Nesting = hierarchical structure

**Interactive:**
- Click node to highlight in text
- Hover for details
- Zoom and pan
- Collapse/expand sections
- Export as image

**Updates as you type:**
- Add `->` see new connection
- Create `{ }` see new node
- Change structure, graph updates instantly

---

### 3. JSON Schema Generation

**For deterministic outputs:**

Your FlowScript:
```
{
  task: implement feature X
  dependencies: [A, B, C]
  blockers: [D pending, E in review]
  priority: high
}
```

Generated JSON:
```json
{
  "task": {
    "name": "implement feature X",
    "dependencies": ["A", "B", "C"],
    "blockers": [
      {"item": "D", "status": "pending"},
      {"item": "E", "status": "in review"}
    ],
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Consistent AI outputs (always same structure)
- API integration (parseable responses)
- Automation workflows (reliable data format)
- Protocol Memory integration (structured ingest)

---

## Use Cases

### System Architecture Planning

```
{
  current architecture:
  -> monolith (single deployment)
  -> PostgreSQL (single database)
  -> Redis (shared cache)
  
  problems:
  ! scaling bottleneck <- all traffic hits monolith
  ! database contention <- multiple services same DB
  
  options:
  {
    Option A: Microservices
    ++ independent scaling
    ++ team autonomy
    risk: operational complexity
    risk: distributed transactions
  }
  ><
  {
    Option B: Modular monolith
    ++ simpler operations
    ++ shared transactions easy
    ~ scaling less flexible
  }
  
  decision factors:
  team size >< architecture complexity
  ? can team handle microservices ops?
  
  [exploring] prototype both, measure overhead
}
```

**Visual preview shows:**
- Current state box
- Problem nodes in red
- Option A and B as separate branches
- Tradeoff edge between them
- Decision factors connected to both
- Question node in orange

---

### Bug Triage and Debugging

```
! production issue: auth failures (15% of logins)

investigation:
-> check Redis: ✓ healthy
-> check Postgres: ✓ healthy
-> check network: ! latency spike 2pm-3pm
   <- correlates with issue start time
   -> hypothesis: timeout during latency

? root cause: network or timeout config?

tests:
[decided] reduce timeout threshold <- validate hypothesis
[blocked] full network trace <- need SRE access

action: implement timeout adjustment
-> deploy to staging
-> monitor for 24h
-> if successful, production deploy
```

**Visual preview shows:**
- Issue node (red, urgent)
- Investigation path (sequential arrows)
- Hypothesis connection (dotted line)
- Blocker in orange
- Action sequence in green

---

### Feature Planning and Dependencies

```
{
  Feature: Real-time collaboration
  
  requirements:
  -> WebSocket server
  -> Conflict resolution algorithm
  -> User presence tracking
  -> Concurrent editing UI
  
  dependencies:
  WebSocket server <- requires: infrastructure setup
  Conflict resolution <- requires: algorithm research
  UI changes <- requires: design approval
  
  sequence:
  1. [decided] Research CRDT algorithms (week 1)
  2. [blocked] Infrastructure setup <- waiting on DevOps
  3. [parking] UI design <- do after algorithm chosen
  4. [exploring] Testing strategy <- TBD
  
  risks:
  ! complexity >< timeline
  ? can we ship in 6 weeks with quality?
}
```

**Visual preview shows:**
- Feature box at top
- Requirements as child nodes
- Dependencies shown with arrows back to requirements
- Sequence numbered 1-4 with status colors
- Risk node connected to timeline

## Learning Curve

**The Editor requires learning FlowScript syntax.**

This is intentional. The syntax is the tool. Learning it enables:
- Thinking in structure (forces clarity)
- Seeing relationships (topology visible)
- Expressing complexity (prose can't handle)

**Time to proficiency:**
- **15 minutes:** Understand core 3-4 markers
- **1 hour:** Comfortable with basic structures
- **1 week:** Fluent with common patterns
- **1 month:** Creating complex thought maps naturally

**Learning resources:**
- **→ [Learning Guide](../FLOWSCRIPT_LEARNING.md)** - Start here (5 minutes)
- **→ [Syntax Reference](../FLOWSCRIPT_SYNTAX.md)** - Complete documentation
- **→ [Examples](../FLOWSCRIPT_EXAMPLES.md)** - Real-world patterns
- Interactive tutorials (coming with Editor launch)

**The curve is shallow but real. Worth it for power users.**

---

## The Philosophy

**Core belief:** For users who already master language, provide tools that enable impossible expressions.

Prose is powerful but limited. It's linear. It buries relationships. It's ambiguous about dependencies.

**FlowScript + visual preview = thinking tool, not just communication tool.**

- Write to think (structure forces clarity)
- Think to understand (topology reveals patterns)
- Understand to communicate (precision enables collaboration)

**The Editor amplifies your existing mastery.**

You already think in structure. We make that structure visible. You already see relationships. We make those relationships explicit.

**Not a crutch. An amplifier.**

---

## FAQ

**Q: Do I have to learn FlowScript?**
A: Yes. That's the point. The syntax enables the power. But it's only 20 markers, and you can start with 3.

**Q: Can I just use The Bridge instead?**
A: The Bridge is for simple prompts and general users. The Editor is for complex technical work. Different tools, different audiences.

**Q: Why not just a GUI?**
A: GUIs are slow for complex structures. Text is fast. Visual preview gives you both: speed of text + clarity of visuals.

**Q: Does the graph replace the text?**
A: No. Text is primary (portable, fast). Graph is secondary (visual aid, validation). Both together are powerful.

**Q: Will it work with my workflow?**
A: Designed to integrate: exports to markdown, generates JSON, works with git. Build it into your existing process.

**Q: Is this just for programmers?**
A: No. For anyone who works with complex, interconnected information. Legal writers, researchers, project managers, technical writers, architects - anyone who needs precision.

## The Promise

**Express impossible thought structures. Amplify your communication mastery.**

That's what The Editor delivers.

You already think in complex ways. You already see relationships. You already structure information.

**We just make it visible. Explicit. Shareable.**

Stop fighting with prose to express topology. Use the right tool for the job.
